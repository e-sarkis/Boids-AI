# Boids-AI
Boids-AI is a Unity3D Boids demo project!
# What is Boids?
[Boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) is a classic computer model for coordinated animal motion created in 1986 by [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/index.html).
# Managed versus autonomous?
Managed "boids" (represented in the demo as Goldfish) are provided goal location information by their parental BoidsController.

Autonomous "boids" (represented in the demo as Trout) are not provided a goal location by their parent BoidsController.

All "boids" recognize other "boids" (fish or trout) in their flocking calculations, given the meet consideration criteria such as distance.
