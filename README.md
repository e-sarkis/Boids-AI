# What is Boids?
[Boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) is a classic computer model for coordinated animal motion created in 1986 by [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/index.html).
# Managed
Managed "boids" (represented in the demo as Goldfish) are provided goal location information by their parental BoidsController.
# Autonomous
Autonomous "boids" (represented in the demo as Trout) are not provided a goal location by their parent BoidsController.
# Managed-Autonomous Interaction
All "boids" recognize other "boids" (fish or trout) in their flocking calculations, given the meet consideration criteria such as distance.

# Style
I followed the [CoreFX C# Coding Style](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md).
